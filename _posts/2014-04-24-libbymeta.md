## My Experience
I enjoyed Wordpress Chapel Hill and Stacked a lot. There were very friendly and diverse people in both groups. I learned some
useful stuff in addition to meeting new people. It was worth a little driving to attend both meetups. 

I can't say the same for the Python group, however... As I wrote in my post for that meetup, the group was
very awkward to be in, and I only got mumbled one word answers from people I tried to talk to. I would not go 
back for another meeting. I had heard good things about the group, and was pretty disappointed.
Overall, I'm glad that I put myself out in the hacking community more this semester. It was pretty cool to talk to
people about projects they are working on, and learn new skills.

As I take more SILS classes in the coming semesters, I may keep an eye open for relevant meetups around the community.
The Wordpress meetup helped me with my Web Development course (although I didn't think it would at the time, since we never got 
into PHP (see post)). Also, being able to talk to more experienced people outside of a classroom setting is very useful.
